# Product Owner & Scrum Master Task
## “Unit Logbook” – Lean Product Backlog & Delivery Plan


### Backstory
*Your platoon still keeps a **paper logbook** for day-to-day events in the field.*

*A lightweight multiplayer browser app would boost situational awareness by letting everyone see—at a glance—what’s been done and what still needs doing.*

You have been asked to make this product happen with  a squad of developers.

---

## 1 Goal  

Produce a **concise product-management package** that a new dev team could pick up on Monday and start delivering the **Unit Logbook Proof-of-Concept**.

> **Time-box:** **1 – 6 hours**  
> **Tools:** Issues to your `Github repository issue tracker`, and a `Github Projects` kanban board.
> **No coding required.**

---

## 2  Deliverables  

| # | Artefact | Should include |
|---|----------|--------------|
| 1 | **Product Concept one-pager** (`vision.md`) | Short paper on Why-What-How of this product. A Dev should grasp what they're up to with Unit Logbook. |
| 2 | **Product backlog**  | Slice your concept into meaningful pieces of work that a dev team could handle. This slicing should be stored as Issues in your repository Issue Tracker, and listed into your Github Projects kanban. 
| 3 | **Definition of Done** for your slicing | Remember to write up Definition of Done for each sliced item (When this thing can be defined as done?). |
| 4 | **Roadmap** | Your slicing should include a simple roadmap that shows what is the starting point of timing for releasing the Unit Logbook Proof-of-Concept.  |

---

## 3  Context constraints  

* Platform: **browser app**, running on laptops & tablets.  
* Data model (from other tracks): `id`, `title`, `body`, optional `lat`, `lon`, `isoTime`.  
* Connectivity is “standard field network” (assume intermittent but you don’t need to design offline capabilities).  
* Team size: **4 conscripts** (2 devs, 1 PX, 1 infra).  
* Stakeholders: Platoon leader (primary), Company HQ (secondary).

---

## 4  Stretch goals (optional)  

| Goal | Idea |
|----|------|
| Issue templates | Do nice issue templates to your Github repository that makes it easy for developers to write up their tickets. |
| Team Charter / Execution Note | Write short guidance for your team on how we execute this project. |


---

## 5  Submission checklist  

| ✔︎ | Item |
|----|------|
|   | `CONCEPT.md` articulates product vision, goals and success metrics. |
|   | Sliced up the Concept to meaningful pieces, exhibited as Issues on your forked repository's issue tracker & Github Projects kanban board |
|   | Roadmap or crude timing on when happens what. |
|   | Artefacts committed in `challenges/product-owner/` and linked from root README. |
