# PX (Product Experience) Task
## “Unit Logbook” product experience

### Backstory
*Your platoon still keeps a **paper logbook** for day-to-day events in the field.*

*A lightweight multiplayer browser app would boost situational awareness by letting everyone see—at a glance—what’s been done and what still needs doing.*

---

## 1  Goal

Create a **concise product-experience package** (wireframes + explanatory notes) that shows how the Unit Logbook should look, feel, and flow.

> **Time box:** aim for **3–6 h** total.  
> **Tools:** any design tool you like (Figma, Adobe XD, Pen-&-Paper → photo, Excalidraw…).  
> **No coding required.**

---

## 2  Deliverables

| # | Deliverable | Must include |
|---|-------------|--------------|
| 1 | **User-flow diagram** | Key moments: *open app → read log → add entry → sync later*. |
| 2 | **Wireframes** (mobile or small-tablet viewport) | ✔ Log list view<br>✔ “Add entry” modal/drawer<br>✔ Indicator for offline / sync state |
| 3 | **1-page rationale** | • Primary user (“Squad Leader” persona) and pain-points <br>• Design principles (e.g. daylight readability, low data use) <br>• 3 acceptance criteria for MVP |
| 4 | **Link** | Public Figma/XD/Miro URL **or** PDF/pngs in your repo’s `/design/` folder. |

---

## 3  Functional assumptions

* Log entry fields: **title**, **body**, optional **lat / lon** (GPS).  
* Users wear gloves; large tap-targets are appreciated.
